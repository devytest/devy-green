DEVY GREEEN:
===============================================
Completed Today:
  x fix the firebase popup issue
  x DL and save firebase code (cache it)
  x On page load, tests should be re-run for code already entered and marked as passing/failing
  x Requires concurrent tape processes running
  x FIX: Leaking adding text to other popovers
  x Display popovers on startup
  X Enable dismiss all popovers
  x Figure out how to provide actual/expected feedback without confusing students
  x Display source on incorrect return val modules
  X Escape key shoudl dismiss popovers
  x Clicking reset should dismiss the popover if it's open
  x Popovers should disappear when re-run

Current tasks:

  - Enhanced UX:
    - Clear correct entry on right click
  - Re-implement panel completion checking based on passing all tests
  - Test Results Module Styling:
    - if ALL tests passed or not (popover color icon?)
    - make source code popover style match test popover style 

  - Make default text color white



////////////////////////

    - Run/test/display all buttons
    - Provide a grade report as an overlay
      - Number of tests passed out of total

===============================
Notes from DD Meeting 6/17/16:

- let students do quick 'think-pair-share' sessions
- t.sayFullName() --> this.say(this.getFullName())
- talk through how code works
- dont be afraid of productive failure
- when explaining classes, give multiple examples
  -> person, car, printer, etc.

  - inside the class vs outside the class
    - 'this' == 'my'
Apps:
- Trainer Studio
  - GUI starts out empty, instructs students to fill in each piece
    - trainer details
    - app details
    - buttons
  - Review of functions, basic data types, and returning data
    - GUI has 'app details' slots that need to be filled in
      - app name
      - app credits
      - app version
      - app year
      - app complete
    - Create app Details as individual functions
    - Call functions in browser console
  - Intro to ordinary objects
    - motivation: we want to define something that has multiple attributes
    - Return App Details as a single object
    - review of the data types we've used so far, but we realize none of them will work
      - numbers
      - strings
      - booleans
      - arrays (?)
    - Objects defined as a collection of related data
    - Create the trainer first as an ordinary object (i.e. not a class)
    - Get stats table working
      - stats table displays static attributes 
        (i.e. not computed by a method)
    
  - Intro to classes
    - Motivation: Now we want our trainer to DO something when we click on various buttons. But it can't because it's just data. So we introduce classes as objects that not only have data but also have methods.
  - GUI:
    - buttons to trigger predefined functions
    - command prompt to accept code to execute
    - log area to show output
  - concepts used in methods:
    - constructors and setting instance variables (requires 'this')
    - executing statements without returning anything
    - executing outside functions within a method
        - sayHi()
    - executing statements and returning something
      - getTime()
    - using a parameter passed into the function
      - say(message)
    - using local variables within the method
    - reading instance variables (requires 'this')
      - sayMotto()
      - imageFileName()
    - incrementing/updating instance variables (requires 'this')
    - calculating values in functions
    - calling other methods within a method (requires 'this')
    - more complex methods
      - e.g.: conditionals + calculation + calling other methods

- Pokemon Studio
  - Concepts:
    - more practice with objects, state etc
    - arrays,
      - selecting attacks
      - max, min, etc.
    - trainer object using pokemon object?
- Battle


========================
The Multiple Screens Idea:

To make the learning curve less steep, we break up the game into
a series of apps. Start with a demo of the full battle, showing the students what we're working towards. Then we move to
Trainer Studio, then Pokemon Studio, then Battle

  - order curriculum
=================================
New UI Concept for Trainer Studio


=================
New Trainer attributes:

- position: x, y
  - moveLeft(num)
  - moveUp(num)
  - move(x, y)
- TTS 
  - sayX() vs displayX()
  - setVoice()
  - 
============

Notes from Meeting with Dave:
- Concepts should be reinforeced as they're progressed
- Return/review concepts from previous lesson
- Insert outside exercises where necessary
- Decide on performance objective at each point in the curric
- Syntax exercises
- Syntax cheat sheet
- Fill-in-the-blank methods


====================================================
Next tasks:

- Implement
  - calculated attributes
    - Full Name
    - League
    - Weak Element
    - Favorite Color (changes background)

GUI Improvements:
  - choose fonts
  - style buttons
  - hide/disable buttons when not usable
  - set continue button as default focus so hitting enter key works
  - Add sound effects 
  - add logo

- Write unit tests
- Let player have multiple pokemon

=================================


==============================================
